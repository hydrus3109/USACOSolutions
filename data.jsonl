{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "s"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Due to the disorganized structure of his mootels (much like motels but with bovine rather than human guests), Farmer John has decided to take up the role of the mootel custodian to restore order to the stalls. Each mootel has N stalls labeled 1 through N (1≤N≤105 ) and M (0≤M≤105 ) corridors that connect pairs of stalls to each other bidirectionally. The i th stall is painted with color Ci and initially has a single key of color Si in it. FJ will have to rearrange the keys to appease the cows and restore order to the stalls. FJ starts out in stall 1 without holding any keys and is allowed to repeatedly do one of the following moves: Pick up a key in the stall he is currently in. FJ can hold multiple keys at a time. Place down a key he is holding into the stall he is currently in. A stall may hold multiple keys at a time. Enter stall 1 by moving through a corridor. Enter a stall other than stall 1 by moving through a corridor. He can only do this if he currently holds a key that is the same color as the stall he is entering. Unfortunately, it seems that the keys are not in their intended locations. To restore order to FJ's mootel, the i th stall requires that a single key of color Fi is in it. It is guaranteed that S is a permutation of F . For T different mootels (1≤T≤100 ), FJ starts in stall 1 and needs to place every key in its appropriate location, ending back in stall 1 . For each of the T mootels, please answer if it is possible to do this. INPUT FORMAT (input arrives from the terminal / stdin): The first line contains T , the number of mootels (test cases). Each test case will be preceded by a blank line. Then, the first line of each test case contains two integers N and M . The second line of each test case contains N integers. The i -th integer on this line, Ci , means that stall i has color Ci (1≤Ci≤N ). The third line of each test case contains N integers. The i -th integer on this line, Si , means that stall i initially holds a key of color Si (1≤Si≤N ). The fourth line of each test case contains N integers. The i -th integer on this line, Fi , means that stall i needs to have a key of color Fi in it (1≤Fi≤N ). The next M lines of each test case follow. The i -th of these lines contains two distinct integers, ui and vi (1≤ui,vi≤N ). This represents that a corridor exists between stalls ui and vi . No corridors are repeated. The sum of N over all mootels will not exceed 105 , and the sum of M over all mootels will not exceed 2⋅105 . OUTPUT FORMAT (print output to the terminal / stdout): For each mootel, output YES on a new line if there exists a way for FJ to return a key of color Fi to each stall i and end back in stall 1 . Otherwise, output NO on a new line.

This works because having a key is always better than not having a key. This can be done in O(N+M) . If there are some keys that we can't pick up, we must ensure these keys already are in their intended locations (Si=Fi for each stall i that we did not visit in our BFS). If not, print "NO" and return. If yes, and the input is one of inputs 7-10, we can print "YES" and return. Otherwise cut these stalls from the graph and continue with the next stage of the algorithm. At this point in time we have some list of keys that we are holding and a subgraph where each stall in the graph has a color Ci and an intended key of color Fi . Unfortunately, there is no easy way to greedily place the keys. The trick we will use to place down the keys is to notice that if there existed a way to place down the keys, we could reverse that process and it would look almost identical to the previous process of picking up the keys. Thus, we will first assume that every key is in its intended place and then start at stall 1, attempting to pick up keys until we get back to a situation in which we have every key. To do this, we will use the same BFS as before, when we were trying to take keys. The only difference is instead of needing a key of color Ci to enter stall i , we will need a key of color Ci to exit stall i . This means we can only add stall i to the BFS queue if we either already have a key of color Ci or if Ci=Fi . This BFS in reverse works because having more keys at any point in time is better, so we might as well pick up these keys as quickly as we can. If our BFS can visit all nodes then we are certain that a solution exists because we can just run this process in reverse to place down all the keys. If the BFS does not visit all nodes, there can also be no "place" process (if there existed a valid “place” process, reversing it would give us a valid reversed process, which we proved to be impossible because the greedy solution did not find one).
